Knowledge sharing - Semantic layer
==================================

# Overview
[This project](https://github.com/data-engineering-helpers/semantic-layer)
intends to document requirements and referential material about
the semantic layer (_e.g._, metrics, business rules)
in the perspective of data engineering on a modern data stack (MDS).

Even though the members of the GitHub organization may be employed by
some companies, they speak on their personal behalf and do not represent
these companies.

* Verbatim:
> I am finding that I'm starting to do a lot more charting in python notebooks now than I used to; reason being is its brain-dead easy
> to just put a quick prompt on copilot to build you something. As an example, if I have a duckdb query working for me and I want to chart the results,
> I can with this simple copilot prompt in the cell:
> "create a bar chart with matplotlib that shows order counts by month; add a trend line showing the average order count by month". 
> In the screenshot below, you will notice that copilot is smart enough to interpret my natural language prompt and examine the SQL statement
> above and match my request to the actual fields (I did not have to provide a mapping whatsoever). This is literally done in less than a couple seconds
> and I did not have to go crack open another BI tool like Tableau.
> 
> This is been accelerating my Q/A of datasets much faster now; I'm finding less and less a need for traditional BI tools going forward.
